Use the arrow keys to watch the penguin walk in the tundra.

This is a simple way to animate a character using pygame and python 3.

I've included the paintdot.net files if you would like to edit it more.

FIXME: I would like to include all of these animations on a sprite sheet and animate it in that way.

Enjoy!
